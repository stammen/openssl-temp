 INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS 10 UNIVERSAL PLATFORM
 ----------------------------------

 [Instructions for building for Windows CE can be found in INSTALL.WCE]
 [Instructions for building for Win64 can be found in INSTALL.W64]
 [Instructions for building for Win32 can be found in INSTALL.W32]
 [Instructions for building for Windows Phone 8.0/8.1 or Windows Store 8.1 can be found in INSTALL.WINAPP]


 Requirments.
 - You need Perl location for Win32 or Win64 in your PATH environmental variable.
 - Visual Studio 2015
 - Tools for Windows 10 [https://dev.windows.com/en-US/windows-10-developer-preview-tools]

 QUICK MULTI-PLATFORM INSTALL
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Execute the following script in the source root tree.
 > ms\do_vsprojects14.bat

 Open visual studio solution created
 > vsout\openssl.sln


 This file will generate a solution file that contains 4 projects.

 2 OpenSSL Projects

 Universal 10.0 DLL    (Win32|x64|arm)     (Debug|Release)
 Universal 10.0 STATIC (Win32|x86|arm)     (Debug|Release)

 2 Test Apps which host the tests and run them

 Run the test application to validate the libraries. It executes the same tests as the commandline
 test suite.

 Libraries are built on the following location

 vsout\$(ProjectConfiguration)\$(Configuration)\$(Arch)\bin

 Modify ms\do_vsprojects.bat for custom builds

 You can build this solution file via the command line using devenv.exe, or MSBuild.exe, or via the UI

 Once all configuration are build run

 > ms\do_packwinuniversal.bat

 To pack the build output into vsout\package

 SINGLE PLATFORM INSTALL
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Firstly you should run Configure with platform VC-WINUNIVERSAL

 > perl Configure no-asm no-hw no-dso VC-WINUNIVERSAL

 Next you need to build the Makefiles:

   > ms\do_winuniversal

 Then from CMD.exe, the following environment variables must be set for nmake build.

 INCLUDE
 LIB
 LIBPATH

 In addition nmake.exe, link.exe and cl.exe must be available in the environmental variable %PATH%

 Run ms\setVSvars.bat to set this environmental variables, and fix the path if needed, following flavours are supported, If your version is not supported by this batch you will need to manually set previous variables

 ms\setVSvars universal10.0arm
 ms\setVSvars universal10.0Win32
 ms\setVSvars universal10.01x64

 Start nmake compilation with.

 > nmake -f ms\nt.mak init
 > nmake -f ms\nt.mak

 Alternatively you can generate DLLs with the following command

 > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak

 If all is well it should compile and you will have libs for openssl. on the directory out32 or out32dll if DLL build.


 Tweaks:


 Troubleshooting
 ---------------

 Since the Win32 build is only occasionally tested it may not always compile
 cleanly.  If you get an error about functions not having numbers assigned
 when you run ms\do_ms then this means the Win32 ordinal files are not up to
 date. You can do:

 > perl util\mkdef.pl crypto ssl update

 then ms\do_XXX should not give a warning any more. However the numbers that
 get assigned by this technique may not match those that eventually get
 assigned in the Git tree: so anything linked against this version of the
 library may need to be recompiled.

 If you get errors about unresolved symbols there are several possible
 causes.

 If this happens when the DLL is being linked and you have disabled some
 ciphers then it is possible the DEF file generator hasn't removed all
 the disabled symbols: the easiest solution is to edit the DEF files manually
 to delete them. The DEF files are ms\libeay32.def ms\ssleay32.def.

 Another cause is if you missed or ignored the errors about missing numbers
 mentioned above.


 Linking your application
 ------------------------

 If you link with static OpenSSL libraries [those built with ms/nt.mak],
 then you're expected to additionally link your application with
 WS2_32.LIB.
